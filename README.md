# Venus Attack The Game

**PG29 JavaScript Web Apps - Game**

Date: 2025-12-16

## About the Project

This project is to create a game using Planck and Canvas using levels from the level editor.

### What I did:

I took the code that was taken in class as well as the levels from the level editor I made previously. I used AJAX to get the levels from the level folder and imported them into the game.

Here are the new things I have added:
- Catapult: The bird spawns wherever the catapult is placed
- Egg: When hit by the bird it ends the game
- Triangle: A different shape to create cool levels and give variety
- Level reset: Now whenever the player fails a level, it restarts back to the first one

## How To Use

**Step 1:** Clone the respository.

**Step 2:** Make sure to have NodeJS downloaded. Go to the repository in your desktop, open the `VenusAttackLevelEditor` folder and bring up the command line.

**Step 3:** Install the necessary packages with `npm install`

**Step 4:** Start server by `npm run dev` and use the link to open the level editor. 

## How To Play

Click on the bird (red circle) and pull back to launch the bird into the air. Try to hit the pigs (green circles) to kill them. If you kill all the pigs in the level it moves onto the next. Avoid hitting the eggs (yellow circles) as if they crack you lose the game.
